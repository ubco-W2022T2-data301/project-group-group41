I will use the columns of 'date', 'team1', 'team2', 'spi1', 'spi2', 'score1', 'score2' as the data basis for my research question. These data should be able to support my research question by comparing the relationship between team, spi and score under different dates.In addition, the potential relationship can be analyzed based on the score and spi ratio between the two teams in each match.\n",
