## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We are interested in this dataset because it relates to a high-profile event in the world of soccer, and provides an opportunity to explore the use of data and analytics in predicting the outcome of a sporting competition.

The goal of this project would be to analyze the predictions made by FiveThirtyEight and evaluate their accuracy. This could involve comparing the predictions to the actual outcome of the tournament, and exploring any factors that may have affected the accuracy of the predictions.

Additionally, it would be interesting to explore the methods used by FiveThirtyEight to generate their predictions, and to compare their approach to other methods used to make predictions in the sports world.

Building a user-facing dashboard with this dataset could be a valuable tool for soccer fans, providing insights into the likelihood of different teams winning the tournament, and allowing users to explore the predictions in more detail. The dashboard could be interactive, allowing users to see how the predictions evolved over the course of the tournament, and how the actual results compared to the initial predictions.
